Coronavirus disease 2019 (Covid-19) is now a global health crisis. According to the Situation Report declared by the World Health Organization, as of June 30, 2020, the number of Covid-19 confirmed cases has reached 10,185,374 globally. With the temperature getting higher and higher, more and more people begin to expect the arrival of summer can make the virus completely disappear as Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) in 2003. But will this expectation come true? Will Covid-19 back in fall? In this project, we find out the relationship between the number of Covid-19 confirmed cases and temperature from March 2020 to June 2020. We collected the total number of confirmed cases per month in 188 countries/regions and their average monthly temperature. Then we use correlation coefficient to measure the strength and direction of the linear relationship between two variables. We find the two variables almost have no relationship. Moreover, we use K-Means clustering method to divide the countries into 10 groups based on the confirmed cases. But there is no similarity or correlation in the temperature of the members in each group. We may conclude that the Covid-19 has no relationship with temperature
